📝 React Todo App

Welcome to my React Todo App! This is one of my first projects built while learning React. It’s a simple yet functional application that allows users to manage a list of tasks with ease. The app connects to an external API to fetch and update todos, giving me hands-on experience working with real data.

🚀 Features

✅ Add new todos
❌ Delete todos
📝 Mark todos as completed
🔄 Fetch todos from an API
⚡ Interactive and responsive UI

📌 Future Improvements

Add local storage support
Edit existing todos
Filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending)
Improve styling and animations
