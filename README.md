# 📝 React Todo App

Welcome to my **React Todo App**! This is one of my first projects built while learning **React**. It’s a simple yet functional application that allows users to manage a list of tasks easily. The app connects to an external **API** to fetch and update todos, giving me hands-on experience working with real data.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Add new todos  
- ❌ Delete todos  
- 📝 Mark todos as completed  
- 🔄 Fetch todos from an API  
- ⚡ Interactive and responsive UI  

## 🛠️ Built With
- **React** – Frontend framework  
- **TypeScript** – Static typing  
- **CSS** – Basic styling  
- **API** – Consuming a placeholder API for todos  

## 🎯 What I Learned
- React fundamentals (components, props, state, hooks)
- Handling API requests
- Managing component state with TypeScript
- Working with types and interfaces
- Conditional rendering
- Basic project structure in React + TypeScript

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add local storage support
- Edit existing todos
- Filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending)
- Improve styling and animations
